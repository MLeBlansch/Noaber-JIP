Todos: compensation and feed in tariff can stack?!

This cost structure does the following: given a fixed price including tax, this will calculate the price that needs to be paid after one year.
Net metering can also be included, ranging from 0% (no net metering) to 100% (net metering up until total consumption).
The reasonable compensation for everything produced above 100% is also included.
Finally, a fixed feed-in tariff can be added too. (Can also function as as feed-in fine)

output = fixedPriceNetMetering(powerConsumption, netMeteringFraction, reasonableCompensation, feedInTariff, fixedPrice)

powerConsumption:
type: Pandas dataframe
index: 'local_time'
columns: 'to grid', 'from grid' in kWh per timestep

netMeteringFraction:
type: float, 0<=netMeteringFraction<=1

reasonableCompensation:
type: float, >0
unit: euros/kWh

feedInTariff
type: float
unit: euros/kWh
note = negative feedInTariff means you pay money for every kWh you give to the grid, like a fine. Use with 0% netMeteringFraction if positive

fixedPrice:
type: float
unit: euros/kWh
